# Learning Experience
Our journey started with knowledge about closed BIM softwares, but no knowledge related to OpenBIM, IFC and some basics skills about Python. Therefore, we were in OpenBIM Modeller Level 1. Now we consider ourselves:
•	Modeller Level 2 (since we worked with BlenderBIM and IFC).
•	Analyst Level 3 (since we developed a Python programme using ifcOpenShell).
•	Manager Level 2 (since we handled Excel files generated by IFA and created BPMN).
•	Guru Level 1 (since we wrote a markdown and video tutorials).

##	What else do you still need to learn
There are still a bunch of different things that it would be nice to learn, such as coding skills, HTML, machine learning, etc.

## How you might use OpenBIM in the future
It can be used for extract and input information on an IFC model in an efficient way. It might even be used for creating an IFC model from the scratch, and end up performing structural analysis.

# Process of developing the tutorial
##  Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?
OpenBIM and Python have many options that can be useful to run process automatically instead of spending a lot of time doing it manually. Nevertheless, since we have not defined the topic of our thesis, it’s quite early to say if this course might be helpful or not.

## Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?
We think it’s not a matter of having less or more choices in the use case. At the beginning of the course, those who were not into IFC didn’t understand what IFC is, and what type and amount of information it contains. Therefore, we struggled to define a clear usecase, since we didn’t know what the limitations were what would be possible for us to code through the course.

## Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?
For our point of view, less tools would have been better. Some of the tools like Linked Data and Node-RED were just introduced, but we do not know how to apply them in our code. So, we believe that less tools which are explained better and implemented.
