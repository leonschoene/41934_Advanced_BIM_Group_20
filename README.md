# 41934 Advanced BIM Group 20 Assignment 2
We are both studying civil engineering, so we chose the structural focus area and the structural IFC model for this assignment. 
## Use Case
Structural engineers need a simplified structural model. For that, our script calculate the start and end points of each loadbearing beam and column. Following, a point cloud out of start and end point is created and concected by lines. The start and end point represent the nodes and the lines the elements in a simplified structural model. That model can then be exported for other FEM softwares.
