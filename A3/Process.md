Before using the tool it is important that the person who gives you the IFC file exported an IFC4 file. Otherwise, the code is not able to run because the commands in ifcopenshell are different for IFC2x3 and IFC4. 
The person who uses the tool afterward should check if the code works also for his or her project. The code we wrote is especially for beams and columns and also works for that.
The setup is not tested for slabs, foundations, or other structural elements.
The information is written into a report that can be used to get a permit from authorities or as a readable version for persons that do not rely on the topic, e.g. various customers.
The process can be iterative. In the beginning, there must be load-bearing elements before the tool starts. In the end, before the report is created, the user has to prove, that the results are acceptable.
